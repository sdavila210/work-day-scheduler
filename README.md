# work-day-scheduler
Using third-party API's to create a calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of a typical work day.

## Description

This is a webpage that was created using Javascript and third-party API's to create a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour from 9am-5pm. It displays the current date at the top of the page, and the application runs in browser and features dynamically updated HTML & CSS powered by jQuery. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this webpage, the user can type in an event into the empty text area for a specific hour, and when they press save, their event will be saved using local storage. The event will stay even if the user refreshes the page. The user is presentated with time blocks for the work day and each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. 

## Assets

The following images demonstrate the web application's appearance:
